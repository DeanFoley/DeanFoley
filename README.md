## 💻 Hi there 👋 I'm `Dean`, nice to meet you!
#### ✨ Pronouns: `he/him/his`
#### 🌍 Where Am I: North of England
#### 🛠️ What Am I: Software Engineer

`🖥️` - **I am an engineer with over five years in the industry**. Worked as a software engineer, test engineer and platform engineer! Always more to learn, and never shying away from a challenge!

`🧰` - **Love working in back-end, tooling & platform stuff**. Love working with microservices. Never afraid to get stuck in and get the job done.

`🦾` - **Professionally worked with TypeScript, GoLang and DotNet**. Unprofessionally working with anything and everything that takes my fancy, particularly Rust, Elixir and C/C++.

`✍️` - **Looking to get more involved in open-source software**, as a way to dig into my favourite languages a little more, and contribute where it's needed! Hit me with your best `good-first-issue`s!

`🌱` - **Have worked in Agile development most of my career**; love to improve processes for my teams, work great in teams of any size, love to give presentations, love to deliver lectures. Also done some line management; performance reviews, disciplinary processes, career guidance. I love it! Hoping to get involved in community stuff in Manchester.

`🐧` - **Debian, Fedora, CentOS, and MacOS**. Windows if held at gunpoint.
